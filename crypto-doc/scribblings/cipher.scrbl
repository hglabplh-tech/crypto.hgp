@title[#:tag "cipher"]{Symmetric Encryption}

A cipher (or symmetric-key encryption algorithm) is a reversable
function from variable-length messages to messages. The input is
called the ``plaintext'' and the output is called the ``ciphertext.''
For a good cipher, the ciphertext reveals no information about the
contents of the plaintext (only its length or approximate length); in
particular, it is infeasible to compute the plaintext corresponding to
a given ciphertext without knowing the secret key.

Ciphers are organized into families that share common encryption and
decryption algorithms but differ in parameters such as key length and
block mode. For example, the AES family supports key lengths of 128,
192, and 256 bits, and it supports a wide range of modes, including
CBC, CTR, and GCM.

This library provides both high-level, all-at-once encryption and
decryption operations and low-level, incremental operations.

@defproc[(cipher-spec? [v any/c]) boolean?]{

Returns @racket[#t] if @racket[v] represents a cipher specifier,
@racket[#f] otherwise.

A cipher specifier is one of the following:
@itemlist[

@item{@racket[(list _stream-cipher 'stream)]---where @racket[_stream-cipher] is
one of the following:
@tabular[
#:sep @hspace[4]
#:column-properties '(left center)
(cons
 (list @bold{Stream Ciphers} @bold{AE?} @bold{Key} @bold{Nonce})
 (let ()
   (define all-infos (sort (hash-values known-stream-ciphers) string<? #:key get-s-sort-string))
   (for/list ([ci (in-list all-infos)])
     (list (rktquote (send ci get-cipher-name))
           @elem[(format "~a" (if (send ci aead?) "yes" "no"))]
           @elem[(let ([ks (send ci get-key-size)])
                   (format "~s~a" ks (if (equal? (send ci get-key-sizes) (list ks)) "" "*")))]
           @elem[(format "~s" (send ci get-iv-size))]
           ))))
]}

@item{@racket[(list _block-cipher _block-mode)]---where @racket[_block-cipher]
is one of the following:
@tabular[
#:sep @hspace[4]
#:column-properties '(left center)
(cons
 (list @bold{Block Ciphers} @bold{Block})
 (let ()
   (define all-infos (sort (hash-values known-block-ciphers) > #:key get-blocksize))
   (for/list ([group (in-list (group-by get-blocksize all-infos))])
     (list @elem[(add-between
                  (for/list ([ci (in-list (sort group string<? #:key get-b-sort-string))])
                    (rktquote (send ci get-name)))
                  ", ")]
           @elem[(format "~s" (send (car group) get-block-size))]))))
]
and @racket[_block-mode] is one of the following:
@(add-between (for/list ([mode known-block-modes])
                (racket '#,(racketvalfont (format "~a" mode))))
              ", ").}
]

Note that the key length is not considered part of the cipher
specifier; it is determined implicitly from the key provided to
@racket[encrypt], @racket[make-encrypt-ctx], etc.

The CCM block mode is not supported because of its burdensome
requirements: it requires the message and AAD lengths to be known in
advance.

Future versions of this library may add more ciphers to the lists
above and other forms of cipher specifiers.

@racket[ci] is a stream cipher (including block ciphers using a stream
mode such as CTR), returns @racket[1].

A cipher produces a ciphertext that is a multiple of its block
size. If a cipher is used without padding, the plaintext must be a
multiple of the block size.

This library uses a broad interpretation of the term ``IV''. For
example, if @racket[ci] is a block cipher in CTR mode, this function
returns the size of the counter.

An @deftech{authenticated encryption} cipher (with @emph{additionally

addition to the ciphertext. An AEAD cipher provides both
confidentiality and integrity, whereas a non-AEAD cipher only provides
confidentiality.

Encrypt or decrypt, respectively, using the secret @racket[key],
@tech{initialization vector} @racket[iv], and padding mode
@racket[pad-mode].  See @racket[input/c] for accepted values of
@racket[input] and @racket[additional-authenticated-data] and the
rules of their conversion to bytes.

If @racket[ci] is a block cipher and if @racket[pad-mode] is
@racket[#t], then the input is padded using PKCS#7 padding during
encryption, and the padding is checked and removed during decryption;
otherwise if @racket[pad-mode] is @racket[#f], then the input is not
padded, and its length must by divisible by @racket[ci]'s block
size. If @racket[ci] is a stream cipher (including block ciphers using
a stream mode), @racket[pad] is ignored and no padding is
added. Future versions of this library may support additional kinds of
padding.

If @racket[ci] is an @tech{authenticated encryption} (AEAD) cipher,
the @tech{authentication tag} it produces is @emph{attached} to the
ciphertext. That is, @racket[encrypt] appends the authentication tag
to the end of the ciphertext, and @racket[decrypt] extracts the
authentication tag from the end of the ciphertext. The
@racket[auth-size] argument controls the length of the authentication
tag. If authenticated decryption fails, an exception is raised.
